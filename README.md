# Xiaomi XiaoAi Prototype Codes

The following codes are illustrating the interactions between the patients and XiaoAi when XiaoAi intelligent voice service is used in the hospital rooms. The codes will highlight the most probable interactions in strategy 2 (the use of IoMT) and strategy 3 (smart devices x personalised hospitalisation).

Using guidelines: 
1. Paitents can only have one order for each command
2. Patients have to call "小爱" to activate XiaoAi
3. Patients' commands have to include a verb and an object
